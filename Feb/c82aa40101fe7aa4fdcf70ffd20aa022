Durban - Communities living under the Ugu District Municipality are being left without water because the area’s water infrastructure continues to be vandalised at an alarming rate, the municipality says. A number of acts of vandalism have been reported this week. On Wednesday a telemetry system for water monitoring was found vandalised in the uMuziwabantu area. The system had just been installed as part of the “master plan project”. In another incident on Tuesday, Isonti Water Pump Station had its electrical panels stolen, resulting in water outages in a number of areas. According to the municipality spokesperson, France Zama, on inspecting the station, engineers found that all electrical cabling had been stolen. He said electrical components, circuit breakers, motor cables, electrical relays and switches were stolen. He added that deliberate damage to the infrastructure and theft continued to hamper service delivery and was driving up operational and maintenance costs. “These actions perpetrated by syndicates in our communities have dire consequences,” he said. The acts of sabotage started in 2019 after the municipality suspended more than 150 workers for participating in an illegal strike. Since then, the municipality has had several water infrastructure components vandalised and water and sanitation department vehicles have been torched. The municipality said it had joined forces with the SAPS to fight the sabotage. It urged communities to report suspicious or illegal behaviour at and around municipality water infrastructure such as pump stations, reservoirs and valve points. The Mercury
