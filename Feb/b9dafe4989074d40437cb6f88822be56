When Citiliner branched out from its big brother Greyhound in 2005, it aimed to bring affordable bus travel to Africa. Citiliner transported over 500 000 passengers over 8 million kilometres in Southern Africa. Many travellers relied on Greyhound and Citiliner to transport them to various parts of the country - from Johannesburg to Durban to Port Elizabeth. Besides its affordability, travellers got to witness small towns and picturesque landscapes during their journeys. Many South Africans took to Twitter to respond to the news.
