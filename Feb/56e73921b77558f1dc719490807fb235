Durban - An investigation into the leak of Grade 12 examination papers has recommended that pupils who spread the leaked papers via social media should have their results blocked pending an investigation into the matter. The Department of Basic Education was at pains yesterday to stress that its investigation into the matter had found the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate examinations were credible. About 300 pupils had received screenshots of the leaked mathematics paper 2 and physical sciences paper 2. Many of them were high achievers and had not opened the message and the investigation of their scripts did not show any signs of group copying. The investigation found that in KZN about 25 pupils had access to the leaked maths paper and 10 to the physics paper. A report by Hugh Amoore, the chair of the National Investigations Task Team that looked into the matter, said the evidence available to them showed that the leak was minimal and had not compromised the two subjects or examinations. He said they had identified various categories of pupils that had received the leaked papers and had recommended to exam watchdog body, Umalusi, how each should be treated. Umalusi is expected to address the issue this morning. Amoore however expressed confidence in the quality of the examinations, “Based on the evidence we have available at the moment from the investigative marking and the statistical analysis, widespread leaks do not seem to have occurred. “There has been no compromise to the integrity of the 2020 combined examination as a whole. The integrity of the mathematics P2 and physical sciences P2 has not been compromised overall,” he said. The matric results will be released on February 22 and pupils will receive their statement of results at schools on February 23. The Mercury
