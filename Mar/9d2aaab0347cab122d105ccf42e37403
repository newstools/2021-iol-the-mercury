Durban - A Mariannridge ward councillor, who spent almost two weeks battling  Covid-19 last year, lost his twin sister to the disease last month. Reginald Cloete, 49, was admitted to hospital in July last year unable to breathe on his own and spent 13 days in the ICU on a ventilator. Cloete said while he had recovered, his family were dealt a severe blow with the death of his sister Ree Cloete due to Covid-19 in January. “I am trying to cope with her death though it’s hard because we were twins and we had a strong connection,” he said. Cloete strongly believes that health officials need to monitor hospitals, especially government hospitals, very closely. He also called on the government to be more strict with the enforcement of safety regulations and punish those who do not adhere to them. Regarding his health, Cloete said he was very fortunate to have survived Covid-19. However, he said he was left with bruises and was now on chronic medication for his blood pressure and glaucoma. “I do have fears of contracting the virus again because having had Covid-19 before does not make me immune,” said Cloete.
