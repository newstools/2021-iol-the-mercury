Zulu king’s death confirmed as Covid-19 related Earlier on Saturday, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the traditional Prime Minister to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini confirmed that the king’s death on Friday was as a result of complications related to Covid-19. According to Buthelezi, there were divisions within the royal house among relatives who wanted to bury the king in accordance with Zulu traditions, which would have seen his body being taken to all seven Zulu palaces for his subjects to pay their respects before he could be laid to rest. However, other senior members were adamant that the Covid-19 protocols be observed. This has resulted in plans for a lying in state in Nongoma being cancelled on Saturday. IOL
