DURBAN - PREMIER Sihle Zikalala will tomorrow officiate at the launch of a R121 million Nhlalakahle Community Residential Units at uMvoti Municipality. “The 336 units rental project forms part of the department’s CRU Programme aimed at upgrading government-owned communal rental accommodation formerly known as hostels. The National Hostels Upgrade Programme aims to facilitate the provision of secure, stable rental tenure for lower income groupings earning between R800 and R3 500 per month,” said the provincial Department of Human Settlements. Human Settlements spokesperson Mbulelo Baloyi said the people who will be moving into the units will pay for the upkeep of the units by paying 30% of their income towards their rental. He said the uMvoti Municipality would be responsible for the upkeep of the hostel. Tomorrow’s event forms part of province-wide efforts to provide housing for South Africa’s poor. The programme aims to convert single-sex apartheid-era spaces into family community residential units which will be integrated with residents of townships in efforts to build cohesive close-knit communities. The department said it had refurbished 48 units at uMlazi’s T-section at the cost of R19 million. “Another similar project nearing completion is the R445-million Jika Joe CRU in the Msunduzi Municipality whose total room space will consist of 1 164 units with the first 404 units almost completed. The department is also building 150 units at uBuhlebezwe Municipality in Harry Gwala District where the R73 million uBuhlebethu CRU is progressing well. Also in Harry Gwala District Municipality, the department is building a 300-unit Kokstad CRU at a cost of R123 million in Greater Kokstad Municipality,” the department said. Daily News
